<h1>Bonus: Javascript is asynchronous</h1>

<p>Javascript does not nessesariy wait for the code in a function to finish before it moves on</p>

<p>This is a nice feature to have, but it can make coding a little tricky.</p>

<p>To solve this, many functions take functions as arguments for what they should do after completing.</p>
