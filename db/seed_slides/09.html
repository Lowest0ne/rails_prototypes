<h2>Dangerous waters with functions</h3>

<p>Our square function was working well, but now we want to get a cube.</p>
<p>We might start with this:</p>

<code>
function cube( x )
{
  return x * x * x;
}</code>

<p>This may also work, but what if we wanted to raise something to the power of four?</p>
